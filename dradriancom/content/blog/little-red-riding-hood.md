<i>What would little red riding hood sound like if Shakepsear wrote it? I imagine it would go something like this:</i>
 
In time passed, though not long ago, there lived a child, no less, of insatiable sorts. Her nature, defective, her beauty, divine. Beloved by all, mine fair maiden loves not with the heart but looks with the eye; a winged cupid she may pass ye by. A girl so importunate beseeching men of noble estate, their fortunes entirely deflate. So wise, so young, they say, do never live long.

Grandmother, thieved by time, bequeathed to bed, endows upon maiden a riding hood, red velvet tis heavenly crafted. Vainness overcomes the youth; compelled is she to empty her wardrobe anew save the velvet hood. The callet twas named 'little red riding hood.'

In the midst of spring when sproutith the firstlings, mother requested of the ill-nurtured knotty-pated rump-fed progeny:

“Hark little hood fly thee well, <br />
to Grandma's hearth rush beauty's spell.

She tis ill, doth I despair,<br />
thy charm may heal, snigger tis rare.

Thy pride may bore I do foretell,<br />
bear these pastries save her hell.

Keep esteemed manner, thy art a lady,<br />
golden locks and pure and shapely.

Lustrous men may beck and call, <br />
temper thy feelings arouse no gall.

The game is afoot brave the forest, <br />
stray from path be troubled by lewdest.

Seeth thy Grandma aged and wise, <br />
manna by the gods she may arise.

Do thou not utter songs so cheaply, <br />
be calm, polite, kind completely.”

“I yield, mother dear, I do love thee so! In faith shall I heed your words? When happenings be pleasing now and ever after, must I forego my will, my mind, my heart? By cold comfort I suffer thy bidding.”

Into the black wood scorns conceited hood. The treacherous path both long and wide. Advancing her position forest filth underfoot, approaches a character of impeccable poise. Just not so! For unbeknownst to her, he, a dire antagonist so common in tales of fraternal blood Grimm. A wolf! A terrible beast of carnivorous nature; his wicked demeanour and pearly white weaponry red hood seeth not. Fair maiden, unwisely thirsting to rehearse her seductive play, musters speech with garnished eyes: “Gracious praise I applaud thee good sir.” “Daughter of Zeus,” admired the congenial wolf, “it is beknownst to me these lands art not … gentle to womanhood so young. Pray tell, whence art thou?”

“Stout master thy care intrigues me, for alas, I travel unfavourably through grit and dreg to grandma's abode.” Heeding no forethought or mature reprise indolent hood spake with haste, her lips revealing decrepit forebear's dwelling.

Void of sound nay stir a slumbering babe, the composed carnivore carefully considers capricious cause, cleverly. “A tender young creature, a mouthful twofold, consumption befalls beauty and old.”

In elated excitement the wolf exclaimed: “A flower, a flower to furnish thy hair, steal all hearts by gentleman's stare. Go forth in the wood, tame your craves, pick a blossom for thy flowing waves.”

Little hood, nasals raised, dare not let such thought be daised. The sun beams through the trees dancing hither and thither, she chances the thicket her mother a blither. Ill winds which whisper no girl from birth, again and again she picketh from the earth.

Meanwhile, the cunning wolf in a flourished fumed fit fled fast to the fabled forbidden finish. Bursting into bone bag's reside, he devoured her whole save none aside. No mind to fathom from whence he came, on with her clothes, her slippers he did claim. Drawing the curtains hath fate not forgotten? The ignorant girl the woodland begotten. There before thou does suppose, he lay still and pretended deep repose.

A pirate's joy whence-soever gold and gems drown the perils of life compares not to hood's swift jubilation upon finding a utopian floret. Ra's rays mature across nature's garden stage. “I must move with haste!” Little red's beating heart falls to foot, “If mother discovers mine trifling frittering idling I dare shall not live to see the morrow.”

Through the portal she did grovel into the temperate hovel: “Grandma, Grandma, where art thou Grandma?” A supernatural silence surfaces the sinister scene. Hauling the bed curtains twas a sight unnatural! Hood shrieks confronted by this monstrous vision, “Grandma! god hath given you one face, and you make yourself another!”

Aghast and vulnerable, tremulous hood implores:

“Thou cranium protrudes enormous pervasive ears?!” <br />
“All the better to hear your sweet sinceres.”

“Thou malevolent gaze Medusa rivals not?!” <br />
“All the better to glimpse your beauty's trot.”

“Thou hands art mightier than Thor's kin?!” <br />
“All the better to embrace your fair skin.”

“Thou whiskered smile engulfs thy jaw?!” <br />
“All the better to eat you all!”

Scarcely had the monster flapped his lickers, he leapt into the air extending his pickers, close to ruin, hood yowls not for vicars: 'well this knots my knickers!' <i>make sound and gesture of gobbling whole</i>

Equilibrium deterred, proportions deformed, and ultimately unable to balance his bulging belly, our antagonist collapses to slumber. His heavy breath, snorting, snuffling and wheezing.

Passing wolf's refuge twas an Australian hunter of vulgar marsupial game. Possessing a vocabulary substantially debilitated he frequently invigorates his nation's inexpungable hail: “G'day!” wave to the audience “Shh! If you're quiet, and breath deep breath in deep and lock eye contact with someone, you can smell a dingo's breath!” From the English quarters he hearkened the terrifying snuffle. Not dissimilar from Irwin pedigree he cries: “Crikey! What was that?!”

Faster than an emu on curry our trapper charges through the old wretch's castle ingress. And low behold the wolf-beast he long sought slaughtering. Accommodating no firearm intelligence to pillage life, in his hand he seized, instead, a knife. Tall and undaunted he encroached over ravenous scoundrel, foreboding mad imaginings of opponent impaled.   In one foul swoop he cleft feral beast in twain, spilling forth effeminate duo concluding his campaign.

<i>Breath a sigh of relief</i>

Collectively appeased, individually newfound, three ways they parted, homeward bound.

Little Red Riding Hood, unscathed, ponders her mother's words and the encounter with the wolf: 'As long as I live, this above all, to thine own self be true, and it must follow as night follows day, thou canst not ignore change for mine own way.'
