Heather Joy Lawrence, a young nursing student, boarded with a dear elderly couple in Launceston, Australia; Mr \& Mrs Letchford. Every day, Heather rushed through her work and, with the determination of an Olympian, flew home on a bicycle. Now, women may race for fatherly approval, long for a sweetheart's attention or fight for feminine liberty; but not Heather Joy. The BBC tales of a tall disorganised man, possessing an unrivalled intellect and shaking a peculiar screwdriver, were enough to steal Heather's drive.

Bursting through the Letchford's front door, the sound of the TV scared Heather with the thought she may miss that night's episode of Dr. Who. Charging into the living room she was surprised to see a young bearded man settling down to watch her favourite show. Without a second thought and nothing more than a distracted "Hi," Heather jumped into a comfy chair. Roderick, the young bearded man, is the Letchford's oldest son.

The next few years saw many outings, a spark of romance, a wedding and in 1989, I was born. I must have been a marvellous baby or a sheer embarrassment. My parents manufactured eight more of me -- I am still unsure if they actually wanted copies of me, or were self-inflicting disappointment at each failed attempt of a perfect child. 

After Justin and Benjamin, my next two siblings, were born, Dad and Mum executed a monumental idea that changed my family forever. With criticism shooting from every direction, my parents set out to school their progeny themselves. At five years old, I was withdrawn from kindergarten. If ever there is a list of Australian non-conformists, we ought to be on it.

Dad holds a degree in science and a Ph.D in history while Mum is a medical practitioner, a registered nurse. Together, they made fantastic teachers. Their secret: they taught us to teach ourselves. Once we could read and write, they focused on independence. Each and every one of us taught ourselves through most of our education.

By 2005 Teresa, Monica, Catherine and Gerard had been welcomed into this world.

Home-schooling may be considered non-conformist but the best was yet to come. In 2005, I was 15 years old and the reality of not attending a "proper" school was heavy on our minds. However, my parents, resourceful and brilliant, found a solution. A loop-hole exists that is so far removed from institutional thinking my family could not resist its lure. To put it bluntly, the loop-hole makes a School Certificate useless and allows anyone willing to attend university with little effort.

I wanted to be a paramedic. So, just after my 16$^\text{th}$ birthday, I began studying medicine. The same year, Felicity was born. My performance was less than satisfactory. You see, there was a problem; I found medicine to be intellectually boring. That is not to say primates can make it through or that it is not useful. Indeed, it is the noblest and most demanding of professions. Only, spending every waking hour studying massive quantities of information that I could not use for another seven years destroyed my spirit. I wanted to \textit{do} something.

My parents never forced a career on any of us, we were always told, "Do whatever you want to do!" Offering me their hand, I climbed out of medicine and dived into a different river.

In 2007 I started working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science and my youngest sibling, Dominic, was born. Suddenly, the world opened up. Every day was filled with a new discovery, a new way of thinking, or a new ability. I could explore database design and that evening build a working application. Perhaps a lesson on a cleverly designed algorithm would allow me to create a life-like game character. Even mathematics -- I promised myself in school never to study this subject -- taught me new abilities and paradigms that made the world ever more magnificent. Rising every day, I said to myself, "This is what I want to do for the rest of my life!" 

Because I was a distance education student, University was just like home schooling, only better! I studied the subjects I loved the most and when I wanted to do them. Soon, third year undergraduate crept up. Developing an obsession for finance and investing, I worked out an honours project to analyse currency prices with artificial neural networks (artificial brains).

More excited than opening gifts on my 10$^\text{th}$ birthday, I searched for a supervisor. Luck! Someone wanted me. "Don't do neural nets," they said; a heated discussion followed suit. I was determined, nothing would change my mind. In frustration, the distinguished academic slammed down the phone wishing never to speak to me again. Leaving the situation subside for a few days, I phoned back. Another failed attempt to change my mind left him wanting to shake me off. He passed me to a man who became the third most important person in my education -- my parents tie for first place.

I paced up and down the room convincing myself not to change my position. Ready for another fight, I rang Prof. Junbin Gao at Charles Sturt University. "Hello, I'm looking for an honours supervisor. I \textit{will} be researching neural networks." "That's great!" Came the unexpected response, "when can you start?"

Besides from his own inherent brilliance, Junbin Gao is a superb supervisor. He loves independence; a quality perfect for a self-taught young man. Junbin gave me the space I needed to learn and stretch my wings in the world of research. Half way through 2010, Junbin called me into his office. "I need to convince you to do a Ph.D." he says. "Don't bother," I smiled back, "I already want to do it!" Following the usual procedures, he offered me one of several projects he had ready. "No," I said to Junbin's delight, "I have my own project." He accepted the proposal for this thesis. I started in 2011.

Halfway through candidature I, and fellow Ph.D. students, asked Prof. Gao why he stands back and allows us to find our own path. He told us a story. As a young man, Junbin studied pure mathematics, yet, he thought big and was drawn to the exploding field of artificial intelligence. I must make one thing clear. Changing from mathematics to machine learning is only slightly less dramatic than an astronomer becoming an astrologer; a move from solid equations to "if it works, it works." His Ph.D. supervisor did not mind the drastic turn and gave him the room needed to explore and discover. Junbin's recollection shocked and inspired us, not to just finish our work, but, to aim further than we could imagine. Thank you, Prof. Junbin Gao.

Every week for the past two and a half years, I have visited Dr. Lihong Zheng,  my co-supervisor. She is a thoughtful, fresh set of eyes with a different background to my own. I will remember Lihong for her patience and her joyful personality. Thank you, Dr. Lihong Zheng.

My fellow students were full of entertainment. Thank you to Jason Hambly, Anisur Rahman, Geaur Rahman, Lis Sar, Vaenthan Thiruvarudchelvan, Jason Traish, James Bekkema, Bin Liang, Saman Safigh, Nesa Mouzehkesh and Sabih-Ur Rehman, for the fun times together.

This thesis is a testament to my parents and their decision to home school their nine children. With only each other, they embarked on a perilous journey not knowing if they would succeed. They enlightened us to understand rather than know. They nourished us to think rather than follow. They formed us to act rather than wish. Dad and Mum, thank you.
