            I’m responsible for building the machine learning pipeline and
            algorithms at Airtasker. I've built systems to:
          </p>
          <p>
            - Automate platform moderation. Many things posted to the platform
            do not fit with our community guidelines. We have a set of
            algorithms as our front-line defense removing undesirable
            content.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Categorise tasks. Hundreds of thousands of tasks are posted to
            Airtasker. We automatically classify the to help our users find
            what they are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Recommendation systems. Due to the shear volume of tasks on the
            platform, we use recommendation algorithms to help surface the
            right tasks to our users.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Pricing algorithms. Understanding how much a task is worth is
            important for both sides of the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Productionising machine learning algorithms. Developing an
            algorithm is only a small fraction of delivering a machine learning
            solution. Most of the battle is productionising the models in such
            a way that we can rely on them, monitor them, and push out updates
            quickly.

            I built tools to help Mathspace understand their data and create
            more value for their customers and the company. I developed the next
            generation of adaptive learning algorithms to further automate the
            learning experience. Kids are now learning independently.

            I used online data such as Google search logs to predict real world
            behaviour like future stock prices. Highlights include:

            - Engineered software on a Python/Javascript/HTML/CSS stack to
            predict future student numbers of the Warwick Business school and
            improve business operations.

            - Engineered various web tools in for business stakeholders to
            analyse large datasets.-Lead the development or had a hand in
            developing any software that was used outside of our team.

            I developed a rigorous mathematical framework for traditional
